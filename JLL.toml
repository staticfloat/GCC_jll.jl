By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

    license_text = """\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9.

Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

    license_text = """\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

    license_text = """\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9.

Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

    license_text = """                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

    license_text = """\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general\npresumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\nrequirements of the license of GCC.\n\n"""

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"""

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""

    license_text = """\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"""

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\nbelow.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\nbe allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\n    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\n    performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nyour school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library,\nif necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\n  Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\n"""

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\nbears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\nthe file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\ncertain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\nprogram. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\nnon-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\nheader files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\nLibrary for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\ninterface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\non the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\nmodifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\nthe GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\nsubsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\nmodification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\nthe license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\ntarget processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\ninput to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\nphase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\nformat that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\nfor producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\nnon-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\nJava Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\nuse of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\npart of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\nunderstood as starting with the output of the generators or\npreprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\nwith other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\nwork based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\noptimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\nEligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\ncombining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\npropagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\nall Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\nmay then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\nconsistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.

Additional Definitions. \n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version. \n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"""
